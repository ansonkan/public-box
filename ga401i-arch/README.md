The Arch documation itself is really detailed but it is always safer to have video tutorials to follow along. The first 2 Youtube videos walk through all of the step from the installation guide from Arch with a few extra useful setups, such as setting up `sudo`. The 3rd video is for `dwm` as the title suggests. `dwm` is picked becaues it is a tiling window manager and it works out-of-the-box with other [Suckless](https://suckless.org/) softwares, namely `st`, `dmenu` and `slstatus`. They all have the same are installed in the same way and have a `config.h` header file for further configuration. Patches could be found on the Suckless website as well.
